## Abstract
Rapid advancements have been made in extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs). However, extending input modality of LLMs to video data remains a challenging endeavor, especially for long videos. Due to insufficient access to large-scale high-quality video data and the excessive compression of visual features, current methods exhibit limitations in effectively processing long videos. In this paper, we introduce Kangaroo, a powerful Video LMM aimed at addressing these challenges. Confronted with issue of inadequate training data, we develop a data curation system to build a large-scale dataset with high-quality annotations for visionlanguage pre-training and instruction tuning. In addition, we design a curriculum training pipeline with gradually increasing resolution and number of input frames to accommodate long videos. Evaluation results demonstrate that, with 8B parameters, Kangaroo achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of video understanding benchmarks while exhibiting competitive results on others. Particularly, on benchmarks specialized for long videos, Kangaroo excels some larger models with over 10B parameters and proprietary models.

## Highlights
- Large-scale Data Curation. We develop a data curation system to generate captions for open-source and internal videos and construct a video instruction tuning dataset covering a variety of tasks.
- Long-context Video Input. We extend the maximum frames of input videos to 160, with corresponding sequence length up to 22k tokens.
- Superior Performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the a variety of comprehensive benchmarks and outperforms some larger open-source models with over 10B parameters and proprietary models on certain benchmarks.
- Bilingual Conversation. Our model is equipped with the capability of Chinese, English and bilingual conversations, and support single/multi-round conversation paradigms.
